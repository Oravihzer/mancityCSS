        Manchester City Football Club are an English football club based in
        Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of
        English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they
        became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in
        1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester,
        to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923.
        Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, in the first
        season with the current name.[3] Over the course of its history, the
        club has won eight league titles, six FA Cups, eight League Cups, six FA
        Community Shields, and one European Cup Winners' Cup.
